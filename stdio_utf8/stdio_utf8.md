# stdio_utf8

Force UTF-8 on a tool's own text streams, name the encoding policy for child-process
captures, and escape a message that quotes argv or a file name. A pure library (no CLI, no
`__main__`) imported by this project's three CLIs — it owns the one decision each of them needs
to make identically, so the policy lives in one place instead of a copy per tool that drifts.

## Why this exists

Python derives a text stream's encoding from the **locale** whenever that stream is not a
terminal. On Windows that is the legacy ANSI code page (cp1252 on a Western install), which cannot
encode most non-ASCII characters. Two consequences, in opposite directions, from the same cause.

**Write side.** A tool that prints a path it discovered on disk works when run by hand in a UTF-8
terminal and raises `UnicodeEncodeError` the moment stdout is a pipe — which is every scheduled
run, every CI run, and every run whose parent captures it. The bug class is invisible
interactively and certain in automation.

**Read side.** `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` with no explicit `encoding` decodes the child
using the same locale code page. A child emitting UTF-8 therefore decodes to mojibake — or, for a
byte undefined in cp1252 (`0x81`, `0x8D`, `0x8F`, `0x90`, `0x9D`, reachable from Cyrillic, Greek,
and CJK names), raises `UnicodeDecodeError` **on subprocess's reader thread**, where it is
swallowed: `run()` returns with `stdout=None` and the caller fails later with a confusing
`TypeError` that names neither encoding nor the child.

**The two halves are coupled and must be fixed together.** A cp1252 decode followed by a cp1252
encode restores the original bytes *by accident*, which is why a capture-and-reprint tool can look
correct today. Forcing only the output stream to UTF-8 turns that working accident into
double-encoded corruption:

| Stage | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| Child emits (UTF-8 `→`) | `e2 86 92` |
| Parent captures, cp1252 decode | `U+00E2 U+2020 U+2019` (mojibake) |
| Reprinted to a cp1252 stream | `e2 86 92` — correct, by luck |
| Reprinted to a **UTF-8** stream | `c3 a2 e2 80 a0 e2 80 99` — **corrupted** |

So a tool that captures a child and reprints it takes **both** changes, in the same commit, or
neither.

## API

```python
from stdio_utf8 import (
    CAPTURE_ERRORS, ENCODING, ESCAPE_ERRORS, EscapingArgumentParser,
    force_utf8_streams, print_escaped, printable,
)

force_utf8_streams(sys.stdout, sys.stderr)   # -> the stream names actually changed
print_escaped(f"tool: {line}", sys.stdout)    # one message line; never raises on a surrogate
EscapingArgumentParser(prog=...)             # argparse, every message escaped
printable(text)                               # the escape alone, for a message printed elsewhere
ENCODING                                      # "utf-8" -- both directions
CAPTURE_ERRORS                                # "replace" -- child captures only
ESCAPE_ERRORS                                 # "backslashreplace" -- stderr and messages
```

`force_utf8_streams` reconfigures each argument to UTF-8 and returns the names it changed. The
process's **stderr keeps `backslashreplace`**, the handler Python opened it with; **every other
stream, stdout above all, is strict**. The role is read by identity at the call: the stream that
*is* `sys.stderr` keeps the escape, so a tool hands over `sys.stdout, sys.stderr` as they stand,
and any other stream it passes is forced strict. One stream serving as both — `sys.stderr`
pointed at `sys.stdout` — is strict, because data is on it. It forces only the streams it is handed, so it requires at least one, positionally: a
call passing none would force nothing while looking, at the call site, as if it forced the
process's own streams. That call is a type-check error and a `TypeError` rather than a no-op.
Pass `sys.stdout, sys.stderr` explicitly.

Streams it cannot reconfigure are skipped rather than treated as an error, so adopting it can never
destabilize an existing test harness:

- `io.StringIO` — what a test substitutes for stdout — has no `reconfigure` method.
- A closed or detached stream raises `ValueError`.

### Why stdout is strict, stderr escapes, and captures `replace`

Three streams, three policies, each for its own reason.

- **stdout: strict.** It carries a tool's data, and a report that silently mangles a path is
  worse than one that fails loudly. A report never prints a path that is not the real path; one
  it cannot print exactly is a loud failure, on purpose.
- **stderr: `backslashreplace`.** It carries diagnostics, and the one that matters most quotes
  what the operator typed. A refusal of a mistyped argument must print, and exit with the tool's
  own code, rather than become a traceback and exit 1. An escaped byte in a diagnostic misleads
  no one: it names the byte that could not be decoded. `reconfigure(encoding=...)` alone would
  reset the handler to strict, so `force_utf8_streams` names it.
- **Child captures: `replace`.** A child's bytes are *not* ours to guarantee, and one stray byte
  from a third-party tool must not abort the caller's whole run.

Accepted trade-off: a child that genuinely emits cp1252 loses fidelity to `U+FFFD` where it
previously decoded. UTF-8 is what command-line tools overwhelmingly emit, so this is
net-positive for path fidelity.

### A message that quotes argv or a file name

Python decodes argv and file names with `surrogateescape`, so a byte that is not UTF-8 — a
mistyped argument, a name from a filesystem that accepts any bytes — arrives as a **lone
surrogate**, which a strict stream refuses with a `UnicodeEncodeError` traceback and exit 1.

**On stderr the stream handles it**, with no change at the call site: a plain
`print(..., file=sys.stderr)`, a logging handler writing there, and argparse's usage and errors
all print the escape once `force_utf8_streams` has run.

**On stdout the MESSAGE must be escaped**, because the stream stays strict for data. That is
argparse's help and `--version`, which go to stdout, and any human-facing line a tool prints
there:

- **`print_escaped(line, stream)`** for a human-facing line: a refusal, a warning, progress.
- **`EscapingArgumentParser`** in place of `argparse.ArgumentParser`. argparse writes usage,
  help, errors and `--version` through one method, `_print_message`, which it overrides;
  sub-parsers inherit it. Its errors already escape on stderr; what it adds is help and
  `--version` on stdout — under a `prog` taken from an undecodable `argv[0]`, say.
- **`printable(text)`**, the escape alone, for a message built in one place and printed in
  another. It changes only a lone surrogate, spelled as a backslash, `u` and four hex digits,
  and escaping its result again changes nothing.

A tool's **data** does not go through any of these: a path in a report that is not the real path
is the silent corruption the strict stdout exists to refuse.

**Test with a strict stream, never `io.StringIO`**, which stores text without encoding it and so
accepts the surrogate a real stream refuses. `tests/test_escaping.py` uses
`io.TextIOWrapper(io.BytesIO(), encoding="utf-8")`; `tests/test_streams.py` redirects such a
stream INTO `sys.stderr` before forcing, because the role is read by identity.

## How this project's tools import it

Each CLI puts `<root>/stdio_utf8` on `sys.path` before importing it, where `<root>` is the
repository root derived from the CLI's own `__file__` — so moving the checkout needs no edit:

```python
sys.path += [
    str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / name)
    for name in ("stdio_utf8", "help_formatter", "feed_read")
]

import stdio_utf8
```

**One fixed candidate per name, not a search up the ancestors.** A search would also take any
same-named folder *above* the checkout, where a module planted in it would be imported in place
of the real one. Each folder is appended, so the standard library still wins every name.
`tests/test_bootstrap.py` plants exactly such a folder above a copy of this repository and runs
every tool against it, alongside a control proving the planted modules do run under an ancestor
search. mypy cannot see a runtime `sys.path` insert, so `pyproject.toml` lists the folder on
`[tool.mypy] mypy_path` as well.

A missing library is not tolerated silently: the `import` raises a plain `ImportError` naming the
module. A tool that cannot establish its output encoding should fail loudly, not quietly
reintroduce the defect this library exists to remove.

Then, as the first statement in `main()` — before any logging setup, so a warning emitted during
startup is also safe:

```python
stdio_utf8.force_utf8_streams(sys.stdout, sys.stderr)
```

A tool that captures a child's text passes the policy at that subprocess seam, replacing
`text=True` (which is redundant once `encoding` is passed):

```python
proc = subprocess.run(
    argv,
    capture_output=True,
    encoding=stdio_utf8.ENCODING,
    errors=stdio_utf8.CAPTURE_ERRORS,
)
```

None of this project's tools runs a child process today; the capture half is the library's
surface, tested like the rest of it.

## Tests

`test_stdio_utf8.py` is the one entry point: its `load_tests` hook runs the grouped suites in
`tests/` — the stream policy (`test_streams.py`), the escaping boundary (`test_escaping.py`) and
this project's bootstrap (`test_bootstrap.py`) — and it fails loudly if any of them yields fewer
tests than its floor, or if a file appears there that it does not know.
